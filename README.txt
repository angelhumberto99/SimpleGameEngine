This c++ code runs over the SDL2 graphic libraries

if you are running a debian's distribution, try "sudo apt-get install libsdl2*"
for downloading them (without the double quotes).

to compile this program you just need to give permitions to the "compile.sh" archive
which has the instructions for compiling the program

for giving permitions on linux you just need to write "chmod +x compile.sh"

if you want to add more instructions for compiling, you can add them at the end of the compile archive
